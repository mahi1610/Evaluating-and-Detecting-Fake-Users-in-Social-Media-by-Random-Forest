# Evaluating and Detecting Fake Users in Social Media by Random Forest

Step 1 â€“ Import and converting the two JSON files to CSV.

Step 2 - Merge the two datasets.

Step 3 - Finding the correlation between all the variables to find the relation between each entity.

Step 4 - Visualize and understand the data.

Step 5 - Set the trained data and test data 

Step 6 - Generate a larger dataset using GANs and Neural Network.

Step 7 - Using Random Forest, which provides the most significant accuracy.
        a.	Install the required packages
        b.	Load the train data and train the RF model using this data.
        c.	Predict the output on the test data using the trained Random Forest algorithm.
        
Step 8 - Generate Classification report, Confusion matrix and accuracy to compare.
